Design Thinking:
1. Disaster Recovery Strategy: Define the disaster recovery strategy and objectives, including
recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO):

 RTO represents the maximum acceptable downtime for your critical systems and
applications. It defines how quickly you need to recover after a disaster to avoid
significant business disruptions.
 To determine RTO:
 Identify the critical on-premises virtual machine(s) or systems that are vital for
your business operations.
 Consult with key stakeholders, including department heads and IT personnel, to
understand their tolerance for downtime.
 Evaluate the potential financial and operational impact of downtime.
 Define a specific time frame in which these critical systems must be fully
operational again.

 Example: An e-commerce website may have an RTO of 4 hours, meaning that it must
be fully operational within 4 hours after a disaster to prevent significant revenue loss.
2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO):
 RPO represents the maximum acceptable data loss that your organization can tolerate.
It defines how much data your systems can afford to lose in the event of a disaster.
 To determine RPO:
 Identify the critical data and transactions that are generated and processed by
your on-premises virtual machine(s).
 Consult with stakeholders to understand the impact of data loss on business
operations and compliance requirements.
 Evaluate the feasibility and cost of implementing data replication and backup
solutions to meet RPO objectives.

 Example: An accounting department may have an RPO of 15 minutes, meaning that no
more than 15 minutes of financial data can be lost in the event of a disaster.
3. Balancing RTO and RPO:
 I important to strike a balance between RTO and RPO. Reducing RTO typically
requires more resources and investment, while achieving a lower RPO often involves
